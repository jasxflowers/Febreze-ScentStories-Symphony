# Febreze ScentStories
 This repository tracks a simple attempt at reverse engineering the Febreeze ScentStories, specifically its Symphony board from 2004 (2004-05-25). I am curious about reverse engineering the device, partly to miniaturize it further so that more people can look at how others have engineered scent technologies through history.

 ## What needs to be done
 * Reproduce the PCB layout with correct footprints.
 * Identify the FEGO153S mystery microcontroller being used.
 * The disk motor control is a bit mysterious at the moment.
